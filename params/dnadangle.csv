# A table of dangle thermodynamic parameters from Santa Lucia, Nucleic acids re
# search, 2000, table 2. The columns represent nucleotide pairs. Ordered from A
# = 0, C = 1, G = 2, T = 3, the columns numbered from 0 to 15 match the numbers
# representede by nucleotide pairs represented as binary numbers, eg CG = 4 * C
# + 1 * G = 4 * 2 + 1 * 3 = 11, the eleventh column. In each pair, the first nu
# cleotide is the dangle, the second is assumed to be correctly base-paired. Th
# e top row represents 5' dangles and the bottom represents 3' dangles. Imagine
# a standard DNA diagram, with the top strand running 5'->3' and the bottom run
# ning 3'->5'.
